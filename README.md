# Stochastic-Domain-Transfer-MKB
A Python implementation of the Stochastic Domain Transfer Multiple Kernel Boosting algorithm. This algorithm is based on the learning method provided in [Domain Transfer Multiple Kernel Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6136518) and the stochastic kernel boosting approach provided in [MKBoost: A Framework of Multiple Kernel Boosting](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6189347). This algorithm was developed as a part of the _Summer 2022 NSF REU in Big Data & Cybersecurity_ at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona and was a part of the "Detecting Malware in Encrypted Network Traffic" project.


## Special Thanks To:

Thank you to users Wihoho and Qintian0321 for their works on implementations on DTSVM and SimpleMKL respectively that made this implementation possible!
